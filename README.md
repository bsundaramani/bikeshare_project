### Credits
Mostly I searched on Internet to help me with the syntax for these items.
- while and break
- change from float to int
- try and except
- what function to get the most common out of value_counts
- used groupby for the question to combine start and end station

Many syntax for stats function, I got them from the lesson itself, like mode()[0]
